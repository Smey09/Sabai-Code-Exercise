##Exercise:

1. Create a function that could take an argument which is an array of objects. 
    Each object should contain property name and age. The function should 
    return a new list which only contains the user who have higher than 18 years old
2. Given an array of numbers which includes duplicates, 
    use `filter` method to create a new array that contains only unique values
3. Given an array of user objects which include property name and age,
    use the `map` method to create a new array that contains just the names of the users
4. Given an array of date string in the format “YYYY-MM-DD”. 
    Use the ‘map’ method to transform the array [“2024-01-01”, “2024-02-02”, “2024-04-04”] 
    into an array of date strings in the format “DD/MM/YYYY”
5. Given an array of numbers, use the `reduce` method to find the maximum number of the array
6. You have an array of objects where each object has properties `name` and `category`. 
    Use the `reduce` method to group these objects by category.
    - Input: [ 
            {name: “Bread”, category: “Grocery”}, 
            {name: “Butter”, category: “Grocery”}, 
            {name: “Shampoo”, category: “Personal Care”}
        ]
    - Output: { 
            “Grocery”: [“Bread”, “Butter”],
            “Personal Care”: [“Shampoo”]
         }
