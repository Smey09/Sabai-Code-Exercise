1. Given the array of `colors` [“Red”, “Blue”, “Green”], 
    use array destructuring to extract the first and third elements of the array

2. Given the object of person {name: “Alice”, age: 25, job: “Developer”}, 
    use object destructuring to extract the ‘name’ & ‘age’ properties and console.log it out

3. Given the object user { id: 1, name: “Sok”, address: {street: “123 Main St”, city: “PP”}}, 
    use destructuring to extract the street and city

4. Given two arrays of nums1 and nums2, merge them into a new array:
    Nums1 = [1, 2, 3]
    Nums2 = [4, 5, 6]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

5. Write a function that could take any number of arguments and calculates their sum and return it
    Example: console.log(sumAll(1, 2)) // 3
                    console.log(sumAll(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) // 15

6. Given the array ‘points’, extract the first point into a variable and store remaining points in an array
    Example: points = [{x: 1, y:2}, {x:2, y:3}, {x:3, y:4}]
                    console.log(firstPoint) // {x: 1, y: 2}
                    console.log(otherPoints) // [{x:2, y:3}, {x:3, y:4}
                    ]

7. Write a function that takes an object and a list of property names to filter out. 
    Return a new object that contains all the properties of the original object except those specified in the list
    Example: object = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
                    filterProps(object, “b”, “d”) // Should Return:  {a:1, c:3}
