## Instructions:

1. Class Design:
    - Define the Library class with attributes like name and books.
    - Create a separate Book class with attributes like title, author, genre, 
    and available (to track borrowing).

2. Basic Operations:
    * Implement methods for:
        - Adding a book to the library
        - Removing a book (by title or ISBN)
        - Searching for books by title, author, or genre
        - Displaying a list of all available books

3. Borrowing and Returning:
    * Add methods for:
        - Borrowing a book (check for availability, mark as unavailable)
        - Returning a book (mark as available)

4. User Accounts:
    * Create a User class with attributes like name and borrowed_books.
    * Implement methods for users to:
        - Borrow books
        - View their borrowed books

    + Additional Considerations:

        - What properties in above class should be prevented access or modified?
        - What if there are multiple types of users like Admin, Student?
        - What if we want to limit some rules when borrowing books? 
          For example: students are able to borrow up to 5 books while admin has no limit.
