Instructions:
1-Class Design:
    - Define the Library class with attributes like name and books.
    - Create a separate Book class with attributes like title, author, genre, and available (to track borrowing).
2-Basic Operations:
    + Implement methods for:
        - Adding a book to the library
        - Removing a book (by title or ISBN)
        - Searching for books by title, author, or genre
        - Displaying a list of all available books
3-Borrowing and Returning:
    + Add methods for:
        - Borrowing a book (check for availability, mark as unavailable)
        - Returning a book (mark as available)
4-User Accounts:
    + Create a User class with attributes like name and borrowed_books.
    + Implement methods for users to:
        -   Borrow books
        -   View their borrowed books
*** Additional Considerations:
- What properties in above class should be prevented access or modified?
- What if there are multiple types of users like Admin, Student?
- What if we want to limit some rules when borrowing books? For example: students are able to borrow up to 5 books while admin has no limit.
