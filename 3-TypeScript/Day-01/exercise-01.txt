### Practice:

    Create a simple TypeScript application that models a library system. 
Define a library's name as a `string`, the total number of books as a `number`, 
and whether the library is open as a `boolean`. Create an interface named `Book` 
with properties `title`, `author`, and `publishedYear`. Define an array of books 
using the `Book` interface. Create a function that takes a `Book` and a library name 
as parameters, returning a formatted string with the book's details and library name. 
Finally, use this function to display information about a few books.
